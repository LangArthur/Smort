## Movement Algorithms (= Chap 3)

This namespace contains algorithms handling movement of a character into a scene.
Implemented algorithms are :
- seek: seek for a moving target.
- flee: avoid a moving target.

# Requirements
libglu1-mesa-dev

# Todo-list

- [x] test fly algorithm
- [x] add proper doc to movement example
- [x] clean the example for movement
- [x] abstract test scene to implement examples faster
- [ ] add speed limit to seek and fly
- [ ] fix matrix warning
